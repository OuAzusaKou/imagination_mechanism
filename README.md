# Enhancing Data Efficiency in Reinforcement Learning: A Novel Imagination Mechanism Based on Mesh Information Propagation
Expected for further updation, we will update this pretty soon...
# Data-Efficient Reinforcement Learning with Self-Predictive Representations

*Zixing Wang\*, Maowei Jiang\*  

This repo provides code for implementing the [SPR paper](https://openreview.net/forum?id=H8RgPl5OQX)

* [ðŸ“¦ Install ](#install) -- Install relevant dependencies and the project
* [ðŸ”§ Usage ](#usage) -- Commands to run different experiments from the paper

## Install 
To install the requirements, follow these steps:
```bash
# PyTorch
conda install pytorch torchvision -c pytorch
export LC_ALL=C.UTF-8
export LANG=C.UTF-8

# Install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Finally, clone the project
git clone https://github.com/OuAzusaKou/imagination_mechanism
```

## Usage:
<!-- The default branch for the latest and stable changes is `release`. 

* To run SPR with augmentation
```bash
python -m scripts.run --public --game pong --momentum-tau 1.
```

* To run SPR without augmentation
```bash
python -m scripts.run --public --game pong --augmentation none --target-augmentation 0 --momentum-tau 0.01 --dropout 0.5
```

When reporting scores, we average across 10 seeds.  -->
